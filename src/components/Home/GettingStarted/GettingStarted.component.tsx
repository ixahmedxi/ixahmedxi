        To get started using this boilerplate, it is adviced to delete all of the components created
        to showcase this boilerplate that way you can start from a clean point, following the
        instructions below this can be done easily.

        You should then modify the src/pages/index.tsx file to have an empty component so that you
        do not get errors about not finding components, the empty component would look like this.

        Remember to also delete the counterReducer in the store.ts file so that redux does not
        complain about not finding the reducer. You can replace the reducer with a dummy one as a
        start so that redux does not throw errors.{' '}
